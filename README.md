# ROOT REPOSITORY FOR ALL LOW LEVEL PROGRAMMING TASKS

# What is a Low-level programming language ? 
`A low-level programming language is a programming language that provides little or no abstraction from a computer's hardware architecture. It is designed to be close to the machine language that a computer understands, making it more efficient and faster than high-level programming languages.`

# What a Low-level programming languages use for ?
`They are used to write operating systems, device drivers, and other system software that require direct access to hardware resources.
Low-level programming languages work by providing direct access to the computer's hardware resources, such as memory, registers, and input/output ports. 
They use simple instructions that are executed directly by the computer's processor, without the need for a compiler or interpreter. Low-level programming languages are often written in assembly language, which is a human-readable representation of machine language.`

# What are the benefits of low-level programming languages? 
`Low-level programming languages require a deep understanding of computer architecture and hardware, making them more difficult to learn and use than high-level programming languages. However, they provide greater control over the computer's resources and can be used to write highly optimized and efficient code.`
